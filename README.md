# FEUP-LDTS-PROJ

Group project developed by João Pedro Rodrigues Coutinho (up202108787), Joaquim Afonso Marques da Cunha (up202108779) and Miguel Jorge Medeiros Garrido (up202108889) for the "Laboratório de Desenho e Teste de Software" course unit.

This project's objective was to create a Lanterna-based game - a Java library that allows the creation of text-based GUIs - called "Gradle Knights".

We decided to create a game inspired by medieval RPGs like [Eye of the Beholder](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1882260/Eye_of_the_Beholder/) or [Reigns](https://store.steampowered.com/app/474750/Reigns/).

A more complete version of the report can be found [here](docs/README.md).

***NOTE:*** The complete version of the report was written in Portuguese.
